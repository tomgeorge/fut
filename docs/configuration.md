Fut's global presentation configuration is safe, declarative, and
non-executable. Separately, `trusted_commands`, explicitly configured local
extension directories, and trusted project recipes are executable boundaries; see
[Security boundary](#security-boundary).

Fut refuses to start or attach another interactive Fut client from inside one of its terminals. If nesting is intentional, set `FUT_ALLOW_NESTED` in the command's environment to force it, for example `FUT_ALLOW_NESTED=1 fut`.

## Runtime location

Fut keeps its private Unix socket, lock, and daemon log under
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/fut` when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is an absolute path. Otherwise it
uses `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/fut-UID`. Set `FUT_RUNTIME_DIR` to an absolute directory
to override that location, `FUT_SOCKET` to an absolute socket pathname, or pass
`--socket` explicitly. Fut rejects empty or relative explicit overrides; empty
or relative XDG and temporary-directory values are ignored according to their
fallback semantics. Run `fut doctor` to inspect the resolved location without
creating it.

## Location and lifecycle

Fut checks, in order:

1. `config.toml` in the absolute directory passed with `--config-dir`;
2. the absolute path in `FUT_CONFIG`;
3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fut/config.toml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is absolute;
4. `~/.config/fut/config.toml`.

A missing implicit file, including one selected through `--config-dir`, uses defaults and is not created. Pass `--no-config` to use built-in defaults without reading any configuration file; it cannot be combined with `--config-dir`. `--config-dir` and `FUT_CONFIG` must be absolute; `FUT_CONFIG` must exist. Configuration is loaded before an interactive client changes terminal state. Press `Ctrl-b Shift-R` to reload the invoking client's global configuration and then the trusted project extension configuration for the session focused when reload began. Valid global bindings and layout commit first; if the project step fails, Fut keeps those global changes, leaves the project's previous extension configuration active, and explicitly reports the partial success. Control commands and shell completion do not load UI configuration; `fut doctor` reads it without creating runtime state.

Files must be regular UTF-8 files no larger than 64 KiB. Unknown fields, invalid values, unsafe control or bidirectional-formatting characters, ambiguous segments, and out-of-scope tokens are errors.

## Editor completion

Fut publishes a [JSON Schema](/schemas/config.json) for global configuration.
Add this Taplo schema directive as the first line of `config.toml` to get
validation, documentation, and completion in compatible TOML editors:

```toml
#:schema https://fut.sh/schemas/config.json
```

The schema offers built-in action completion for `[ui.bindings]` and
`[ui.hotkeys]`. Installed extension command slugs and extension-owned settings
remain dynamic and are validated by Fut when it loads the configuration.

Closing a pane, tab, workspace, or session asks for confirmation by default. While the prompt is open, it exclusively owns keyboard, paste, and pointer input; resizing the host terminal remains available. A pane close prompt appears over the pane it would close and dims the rest of the window. Set `ui.confirm_close = false` to perform those close actions immediately. This setting is client-local and applies to both keyboard commands and contextual menus. Interactive rename and close actions can change only the session to which that client is attached and resources within it. A tab, workspace, or session close can finish only partway if a later terminal cannot close; Fut reports how many terminals exited and keeps the target marked closing because those exits cannot be undone.

Terminal-native alerts are configured at the top level. They are separate
from coding-agent lifecycle notifications:

```toml
[alerts]
signal_outer_terminal = true # Optional; default false.
```

`signal_outer_terminal` is client-local and emits one BEL when a newly unseen
terminal bell arrives; whether that BEL is audible, visual, or ignored remains
under the containing terminal emulator's control. It is deliberately off by
default.

## Terminal scrollback

Fut retains up to **100 MiB of scrollback per terminal** by default. Storage grows
as output arrives; the full budget is not allocated up front. Set a smaller or
larger budget in bytes:

```toml
[terminal]
scrollback_bytes = 104857600 # 100 MiB (default); 1073741824 is 1 GiB.
```

The budget measures terminal storage, not plain-text output or a fixed number of
lines. Actual storage is subject to internal page sizes and minimum screen storage.
Set `0` to disable scrollback.

Pane terminals use the configuration loaded when the daemon starts. Restart the
daemon to apply a changed budget to panes; client configuration reload does not
resize existing history buffers. Newly opened command popups use the client's
current setting after `Ctrl-b Shift-R`. Alternate-screen applications manage
their own history.

## Default shell

New shell panes, tabs, workspaces, and sessions run the program in `$SHELL`,
falling back to `/bin/sh`. To use a different shell without changing your login
shell or `$SHELL`, set `terminal.shell`:

```toml
[terminal]
shell = "/opt/homebrew/bin/fish" # Absolute, or beginning with ~/.
```

Fut executes this program directly, without arguments. It must be an absolute
path or begin with `~/`; bare program names are rejected rather than looked up
on `PATH`. When it is set, Fut also exports it as `SHELL` to every terminal, so
programs that start your shell—and project commands that return to a prompt
when they exit—use the same one. Commands passed explicitly, such as
`fut tab new -- htop`, are unaffected.

The daemon reads this setting when it starts. Restart the daemon to apply a
change; `Ctrl-b Shift-R` does not affect it.

Omit any field to keep its default value.

An explicitly empty array hides that lane or format.

## Local extensions

`extensions` is an explicit list of trusted directory paths, loaded in order.
Paths beginning with `~/` are resolved from your home directory, relative paths
are resolved from the directory containing `config.toml`, and absolute paths
continue to work unchanged. Fut appends packages enabled through its Fut-owned
local managed store; it never rewrites this array or any other part of
`config.toml`. The complete merged set is accepted or rejected atomically, and
references to extension tokens are validated with it. Fut does not discover or
download extensions.
See [Extensions](extensions.md) for managed install commands, trust boundaries,
hooks, tokens, limits, payloads, and examples. Third-party authors should use
the [Extension authoring guide](extension-authoring.md) as the API contract.

The global file, a trusted project recipe, and each workspace's
`.fut/config.toml` may configure a loaded extension with the same namespaced
table. Values layer global → trusted project → workspace:

```toml
[extension.run]
command = ["just", "run"]
signal = "STATUS:READY" # optional literal readiness marker
click = "owner"         # optional "owner" (default) or "logs"
```

Workspace values recursively override trusted project and global defaults for
explicit commands invoked there. Unknown extension IDs and oversized data are
errors; the extension owns validation of its inner keys and values. Fut gives
extensions the trusted global/project layers separately; the bundled automatic
behaviors use only those values. Workspace-local values remain inert in the
bundled extensions until an explicit command is invoked. See the bundled `run`
extension for optional trusted `auto_start` and manual
`run:restart`, and the bundled `wt` extension for optional existing-worktree
discovery.

## Bindings

Set `ui.prefix` to change the default `ctrl-b` prefix. Bindings are unique
suffixes after it. Set a built-in action or quoted extension command slug under
`[ui.bindings]`; see the [complete defaults table](usage.md#everyday-controls)
for action names. To run an action immediately without entering the prefix,
map the key to the action under `[ui.hotkeys]` instead. Direct hotkeys are
additional: the action's prefixed binding continues to work.

The command palette also includes `rename-session`, `rename-workspace`,
`rename-tab`, `kill-session`, `kill-workspace`, and `kill-tab`. They have no
default bindings; configure the corresponding `rename_*` or `close_*` keys to
add shortcuts. `kill-pane` remains bound through `close_pane` by default.

A prefix, suffix, or hotkey may be one printable character, `ctrl-a` through
`ctrl-z`, `ctrl-space`, `space`, `enter`, `tab`, `esc`, `up`, or `down`. Suffixes
also accept `prefix`, meaning the configured prefix key again. A hotkey cannot
be the configured prefix or share a key with another hotkey. Pause after the
prefix to see the effective bindings, or press prefix then `:` to search the
command palette.

For a Ctrl-Space prefix, set `prefix = "ctrl-space"` under `[ui]`. Fut displays
it as `Ctrl-Space`. By default, pressing the prefix twice focuses the next
notification. To send the literal prefix to the pane instead, rebind
`focus_next_notification` under `[ui.bindings]` (for example, to `"."`). With
Ctrl-Space, pressing the prefix twice then sends a NUL byte (`0x00`).

An `[extension_commands."EXTENSION:COMMAND"]` table can set `args` to replace
the arguments supplied after that extension command's manifest executable.
The arguments are direct strings with no shell interpolation. An empty array
passes no arguments, and unknown qualified command slugs are rejected.

## Trusted commands

Each `[trusted_commands.NAME]` table requires `title` and an executable `program`, plus optional `binding`, `hotkey`, string array `args`, `size`, and `activate_opened` values. `binding` follows the prefix; `hotkey` runs the command directly. `program` supports `~` and `~/` home-directory expansion. `size` and `activate_opened` have the same semantics as an extension command; omitting size preserves the full-terminal surface, while activation defaults to false. Running a command opens a dashed frame containing a temporary PTY, inherits the focused pane process's live working directory, and sends normal terminal input to the command. The frame names the command and identifies the temporary surface; when the process exits, Fut restores the previous panes, focus, and geometry. A bound trusted command may take a built-in's default key, which unbinds that built-in unless it is explicitly rebound under `ui.bindings`. Explicit binding and hotkey collisions and duplicate command keys are rejected. Commands appear in the command palette; prefixed command bindings also appear in delayed which-key help. Configuration reload replaces them atomically.

## Sidebars

Agents is a read-only projection of terminals with an explicit agent integration. Its `scope` is `tab`, `workspace`, `session`, or `global`. Tab, workspace, and session filters use fresh live focus ancestry when available and otherwise fall back to the selected IDs; global needs no focus anchor. Rows under any closing session, workspace, tab, or pane are omitted; screen detection alone does not add a row. Rows show idle, working, blocked, and daemon-wide unread-completed activity plus session/workspace/tab context. Enter navigates with the row's typed pane ID; `global` safely permits cross-session destinations. The separate Notifications dialog remains the unread-attention surface.

Each sidebar width is independently 4 through 80 cells and includes its one-cell inner divider. Each tagged built-in entry uses `component = "workspaces"` or `component = "agents"` and has either `size = "fill"` or a positive fixed row count; each side may contain at most one `fill` and at most one Workspaces component. Left-drag either visible divider to resize only that side. A docked drag preserves at least 40 terminal columns after accounting for the other docked side; an open drawer's divider is also draggable, while a hidden drawer is not. Dragged widths belong only to that attached client: they are not written to configuration, and both configured widths return on reattach or configuration reload. The active workspace is marked with a bullet.

Display, visibility, components, and relevance are independent per side. `display = "expanded"` uses that side's configured width, while `display = "minimized"` uses a fixed six-cell rail. Minimized Workspaces and Agents rows keep stable numeric positions plus current/activity markers. Opening a minimized sidebar temporarily expands its drawer to the configured width; the rail itself is not draggable, but its open drawer remains resizable. Press `m` inside a component to toggle its side. `visibility = "visible"` docks when geometry permits. `visibility = "automatic"` docks when that side has a relevant configured component: Workspaces with multiple live workspaces, or Agents with an integrated terminal in their configured scope. `visibility = "hidden"` leaves the side as an on-demand drawer. Press `h` to cycle that side through visible → automatic → hidden. With the default Workspaces footer, an open sidebar shows `h`, `m`, and `?` on separate lines with their current states; the `nerd_font` preset adds matching visibility, width, and help icons.

The defaults are left Automatic with one Workspaces `fill`, and right Automatic with one session-scoped Agents `fill`; an empty Agents projection therefore consumes no right-side width. Both sides dock when their combined widths leave 40 terminal columns. If only one can fit, allocation is deterministic: left is considered before right. Any hidden, irrelevant, or non-fitting side remains available as its own edge drawer without reducing terminal geometry. The current side's display and visibility appear in the default footer. `sidebar.display` and `sidebar.visibility` expose those labels to custom sidebar chrome. `vertical_divider` must be exactly one grapheme and one display cell.

## Segments, groups, and components

Every segment sets exactly one of:

- `text` — a literal string;
- `token` — a pure value from Fut's already-materialized client/resource state;
- `component` — a layout-aware repeated collection. The only current component is `tabs`.

Token segments may also set `prefix`, `suffix`, `max_width`, `style`, `inverted = true`, and `pill = true`. Prefix and suffix are emitted only when the token is nonempty. Inversion uses terminal reverse-video after normal style composition: the semantic foreground becomes the fill and the glyph uses the underlying terminal background, so it adapts to light and dark themes. A pill requires inversion and adds the configured `pill_left` and `pill_right` glyphs in that fill color around the complete segment, including its affixes. If either cap is empty, as in the Unicode and ASCII presets, Fut renders only the inverted content. Empty tokens emit neither affixes nor caps. Text segments accept `style` but not token-only options. Components must be the only segment in their group and do not accept segment options.

Tab-item content uses the intrinsic display-cell width of its configured segments. The default format supplies one cell of padding on each side; add or remove text segments to adjust that spacing. The Nerd Font preset additionally reserves one cell at each end of every item so its active-tab pill does not move neighboring tabs. New tabs are created unnamed, so their shared title follows the foreground process in the oldest surviving pane. Focusing another pane does not rename the tab. Name a tab with `fut tab new --name` or `Ctrl-b r` to keep that title fixed; renaming it to an empty string restores automatic naming.

Tab-bar lanes contain groups. A group has `segments`, an optional semantic `style`, and a `priority` from 0 through 255. The tabs component is flexible and keeps its active or keyboard-selected item visible. Groups with higher priority than tabs reserve their complete width first. Tabs then grow toward their complete preferred width. Lower-priority groups appear only in remaining space. Left and right lanes stay edge-aligned; the center lane is geometrically centered and clamped between them. Groups never overlap. By default the right lane names the current workspace, truncated at 20 cells.

Workspace rows have intrinsic `left` and `right` lanes; `body` receives the remaining cells and truncates safely. Expanded default rows show the workspace number and name, reserve leading and trailing padding, and use the same current style as the focused tab instead of a separate active marker. With Nerd Font pill caps, only that title line becomes a pill. The minimized rail keeps its compact active-workspace bullet. A nonempty `detail` format adds a second full-width line. Workspaces are unnamed unless explicitly named, presenting as their live location — the work tree (or directory) every open pane is inside, or `multiple` when panes disagree. The default detail aligns under the row name and shows the Git branch at that live location with its short working-tree diff (`+N` inserted, `-N` deleted). The daemon collects those values with bounded background `git` processes and publishes them atomically into the shared resource snapshot, so rendering never waits, attached clients agree, and non-Git locations simply stay empty. Set `detail = []` for compact one-line rows. Header and footer are optional single-line segment lists. At tiny heights Fut preserves resource rows over decorative header/footer content, while switching and error status remains visible.

All widths are terminal display cells. Dynamic values are sanitized and truncated at grapheme boundaries. Bars never wrap.

## Spinners and effects

Run `fut --ui-playground` to browse the built-in non-emoji spinner styles at
their intended speed and preview plain, pulse, wave, inverted, and pill token
treatments—including effect combinations—with the active theme. The standalone
playground reads the normal configuration but does not start or contact a
daemon. Search by typing and move with the arrow keys or `Ctrl-j`/`Ctrl-k`.

Choose a named style or provide a custom, equal-width frame list:

```toml
[ui.spinner]
style = "circle_halves"
# interval = 80 # Override the preset's frame delay.

# Or define a custom spinner. `style` is ignored when frames are present.
# frames = ["-", "\\", "|", "/"]
# interval = 100
```

The interval must be 16–2000 milliseconds. Custom lists accept 1–256 safe,
nonempty frames, each 1–32 display cells wide; every frame must have the same
display width so surrounding UI does not jump. The selected spinner is shared
by agent activity and extension tokens declared with `presentation = "spinner"`.

Pulse alternates the complete text between normal and faint. Wave moves the
faint treatment across its characters. Neither effect changes glyph weight;
affixes participate while pill caps retain a stable fill.

## Styles

The fixed semantic roles are:

- `normal`
- `muted`
- `session`
- `workspace`
- `tab`
- `pane`
- `current`
- `selected`
- `closing`
- `activity`
- `attention`
- `error`
- `divider`
- `added`
- `deleted`

Each style accepts:

```toml
foreground = "yellow"
background = "default"
add_modifiers = ["bold", "underlined"]
remove_modifiers = ["dim"]
```

Modifiers are `bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underlined`, `reversed`, and `crossed_out`.

Colors may be `default`, ANSI names such as `red`, `blue`, `gray`, `dark_gray`, or `light_cyan`, an indexed color such as `index:123`, or exact RGB such as `#12abef`. Indexed colors remain references to the containing terminal's palette; RGB colors remain exact.

Styles compose in this order: normal, group style, token style (`activity`, `attention`, `added`, or `deleted` when supplied), segment style, current, attention, closing, selected. Later foreground/background values replace earlier ones; modifiers are added or removed in sequence. An inverted token adds reverse-video after this composition without discarding the composed colors or modifiers.

## Icons

`unicode` is the default and requires no private-use glyphs. `ascii` uses ASCII for the configurable resource icons; ordinary built-in help and truncation text may still use Unicode. `nerd_font` opts into a small Nerd Fonts v3-oriented resource/state set, and additionally uses its Powerline half-circle caps for focused tabs, expanded workspaces, and token segments configured with `pill = true`. Every icon can be overridden under `[ui.icons]`.

Fut cannot reliably detect the active terminal font. Use [`fut doctor`](doctor.md) for an honest visual probe; it never claims that an installed font is active.

## Security boundary

Everything under `ui` remains non-executable: it has no shell commands, file reads, environment interpolation, networking, functions, or expression language, and presentation tokens resolve only daemon-validated materialized values and actions. `trusted_commands` is a deliberate executable trust boundary. Fut executes its `program` directly with the configured `args` and the client's environment; it does not invoke a shell unless you explicitly configure one. Explicit extension roots, enabled managed extensions, and namespaced project tables are the equivalent trust decision for extension manifests, their packaged commands, token click actions, and values those commands may execute. Managed installation only copies a local package or fetches one explicitly pinned Git commit before validating it; it runs no package scripts, and enablement is the explicit trust decision. An explicit project `recipe` path is also a global trust decision; a repository `.fut/project.toml` becomes executable only after `fut trust [PATH]` approves that canonical file's exact current bytes. Only configure commands, extension directories, and recipes you trust. Commands never run during configuration parsing or rendering; token commands require an explicit click, resource hooks run only from committed daemon mutations, client hooks run only for attachment lifecycle transitions, and recipe tabs, panes, and commands run only while bootstrapping a project session. Trusted recipe extension settings may deliberately make lifecycle hooks perform work such as opening existing worktrees or starting a managed command when the project session is created. The same-user Unix socket is the authorization boundary for token publication, just as it is for other Fut control commands; Fut does not claim to authenticate the publishing process beyond that boundary.
